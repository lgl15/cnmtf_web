cNMTF is a data fusion framework for prioritising reliable associations between single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and diseases. **In this webpage you will find the step-by-step process to run the algorithm on your own data using R scripts.**

<br>

----

## Installation

Install the ***cnmtf*** package directly from the github repository. This process requires the ``devtools`` package :

```{r eval=F, include=TRUE}

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("lgl15/cnmtf")

```

You can check the development version of this R package on [Github](https://github.com/lgl15/cnmtf).

## What is inside the package?

The ***cnmtf*** package provides four categories of functions for preprocessing data, clustering, scoring SNVs and comparing results.

* **Preprocessing functions:**  
These functions will help you to create the inputs for the algorithm.

* **Factorisation functions:**  
Main functions to integrate the input data, generate the low-dimensional matrices and find consensus clusters.

* **Scoring functions:**  
A set of functions to score SNVs and prioritise significant SNV-trait associations from the low-dimensional matrices.

* **Comparing functions:**  
Auxiliary functions to compare your results across different settings of the algorithm.
